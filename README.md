My exam work for the software developer course.

A Java-based management application for a car rental company that allows the company's employees to manage cars, customers and rentals in one desktop application. 
The user interface is built in Eclipse with Swing, the database is MySQL built in MySQL workbench.

The database must run, with created tables before starting the program. Just insert the createDatabase.sql commands to mysql workbench. The database connection can be adjusted in Db.java.
The entry point is Splash.java. Recommended to run it with eclipse
